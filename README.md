Project 8 Write-Up

The website for homework 8 is located at: https://natoneal.github.io/assgn8/

Part 1: In 300 words (only!) describe your website (We will stop reading at 300 words, so please be concise). Include the following:
	The purpose of my website is to present a unified, engaging experience for users to view my user experience design portfolio. As a new user experience designer, I do not have a large breadth of work to show on my website, so I need to make sure that the relevant projects that I do have, are shown to their full potential. In that vein, since I am in the process of building my portfolio, I have built two templates for the project pages, to ensure that I can easily add new projects to my website in the future, even when I am busy with other work. I convey the basic information on how to contact me, my education, resume, etc. I also include information on my projects and background. I also include a section on my hobby of fine art. Which allows potential employers the chance to learn about me beyond my design work. This is generally important because designers generally work on teams, so finding out the fit of a potential designer is important. The target audience of my portfolio website is potential employers. My portfolio presents my projects in a modern and engaging way. The main page starts with a carousel of relevant, detailed pictures from my best projects,


Part 2: Use a bulleted list to describe how a user would interact with your website. For each item in your list, say
the interaction type you implemented (e.g. speech, gesture, form-based wizard, standard web page, etc)
Click on the pictures located on the fine art page. Photoswipe tool allows the user to scroll left and right through the photos, without leaving the enlarged view. 
Hover over the 
how we should reproduce an interesting use case (i.e. click on X on page Y, or scroll on page X, etc.)

Those changes from my original design include: changing the color palette (removing the yellow from the color palette of the sight and adding in a gray), .The new design that I implemented is cleaner, and more modern, which is a better reflection of my design astetic.
